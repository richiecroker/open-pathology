- name: "Methotrexate safety monitoring: LFT monitoring completion rate"
  chart_type: percent
  explanation: >
    An ALT blood test is one of a group of liver function tests (LFTs) which are used to detect problems with the function of the liver.
    Patients taking methotrexate are recommended to have their LFTs checked at least every 3 months.
    Following these recommendations helps identify any signs of liver toxicity in these patients, which reduces the risk of adverse drug events.
  design: |
    This measure shows the percentage of patients aged 18 years and over prescribed methotrexate who had LFTs within the prior 3 months.  
    **The numerator** includes patients aged 18 years and over who were prescribed methotrexate and had LFTs within the prior 3 months.  
    **The denominator** includes patients aged 18 years and over prescribed methotrexate.  
      
    **Notes**  
    - Patients were considered to be prescribed methotrexate if they had received at least **one** prescription in each of **two** consecutive 3-month periods (covering the past 6 months). By doing this, it is less likely that patients who have only recently started methotrexate (and have different monitoring requirements) are included.
    - We have used a 3-month look-back period for LFTs as this aligns with national guidance on [LFT monitoring for patients on methotrexate](https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/rheumatology/keaf522/8322743).
    - We only include patients aged 18 years and over, as paediatric patients often have different monitoring schedules.
  caveats: |
    - In a small number of places, an ALT test may NOT be included within a liver function test.
    - We use codes which represent results reported to GPs so tests requested but not yet reported are not included.
    - Only tests results returned to GPs are included, which will usually exclude tests requested while a person is in hospital and other settings like a private clinic.

    - The 1-month look-back period helps identify more instances where the latest result is out-of-range, since if a longer look-back period was used then it is likely that many out-of-range results would have been superseded by a follow-up test showing an in-range result.
